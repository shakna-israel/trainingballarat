####Domain Names
Domain Names can be hard to get a handle on, expensive, and difficult to manage. A lot of people struggle when it comes to choosing who to buy a domain from, often opting for someone they later find doesn't support the things that they wanted.

####Our Take
Our favourite domain provider is [A Small Orange](http://asmallorange.com/domains/), a green company with fairly amazing customer support.

To save you some trouble, we can provide domain names *at cost* through A Small Orange, and manage them for you. If you later want to manage it yourself, we can pass ownership to you. *(This may involve varying costs due to domain name registration transfer rules)*.

*Most domains start at $15 USD*
