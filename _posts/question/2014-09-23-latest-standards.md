####Latest Standards
Currently, some of the standards on the web include the specifications for HTML5, CSS3, Sass 3.4, PHP5.4.x, Ruby 2.1.x. The list goes on and on.

All these specifications simply tell a web designer what they can and can't do. They're sort of like a list of combo moves in a beat-em-up game.

####Our Take

Clients don't need to know all about the latest specifications.

They do need to know what their website should be able to do. Developing a separate mobile website to your main website is no longer the norm, and only happens in very specific circumstances.

When building a website, it needs to work across most web browsers, and the list of what you need to support is getting longer almost every day.

*Though your needs often vary, here's a small list of what the average website needs to have:*

####Responsive Design
* It works on mobile, tablet, and desktop flawlessly.

####Social Integration
* Either "share me" links to places like Facebook and Twitter
* Or links to your pages and profiles on places like Facebook and Twitter.

####Fast Loading
* If your site takes more than 1.2 seconds (average), to load, you lose half of the people who go to see what your website is.
* If the load time is more than 5 seconds, then you lose 95% of your audience.

####Ease of Use
* People need to know where things are, not to have to look for them.
* Though your website should be unique, it should still feel homely when someone tries to move around the website.

####Responsive Contact Links
* Your website should have a contact form
* But it should also have links, which when you click on them open an email program. Why? Mobile Users. It works for them too.
* All phone numbers should also be links, so that mobile users can click, and then click call.

####Up To Date Information
* If your website looks outdated, or it never seems to change anything, then you will lose customers.
* *One suggestion is to have a calendar of events that automatically updates.*

But, we can help with all of the above.

####Our Skills
We have experts in all the above listed specifications, and each of the things we just listed, that a website needs... Those are things we always make certain of.

An example? Look at our [portfolio]({{ "/portfolio/" | prepend: site.baseurl }}) on a desktop computer.

Look again on a mobile phone.

Same page, same file... Different appearance. Not just working good on both, but mobile doesn't see as much, unless you want to.
