####Flexible Pricing
Though you may get what you pay for with a website - you often cannot afford it.

####Our Take
If you are a:

* Not For Profit
* School
* Community House
* Start-Up

Then mention it when you seek a quote, and we may be able to help you out.

We often accept alternative types of payment, such as goods or services, and we also allow for payment plans.

*On occasion, we also undertake volunteer work - ask, and you may receive.*
